# @lastgram/core
Lastgram's source code. Commands, database thingies and other stuff go in here.

This is abstract code. The code in here isn't tailored to any platform in specific. It's up to the integration libraries to do this.
@l/c allows for quick debugging and reloading. Everything is loaded onto the global scope, which allows for
easier code inspection, profiling and testing.
